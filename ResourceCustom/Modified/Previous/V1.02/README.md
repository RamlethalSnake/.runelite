![visualbug](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d547aa-5f21-4af2-abfd-6f9a5cf6458e)

Make sure to head to the Plugin Hub and look for '[LITE Regen Meter](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/lite-regen-meter)'

![pluginhub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d18b1263-7236-4893-a7f2-bdbc6f94814a)
Hit install.

Then navigate to settings and search for 'Regen'

![settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a78705e-bbf1-4b87-81ef-35c0aaeb4a5a)

Disable the 'Regeneration Meter' and enable the 'LITE Regen Meter' Plugin!

![switchplugin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/736043af-73a8-49eb-8e43-0eba996c10c5)

Access the configuration panel from the plugin and adjust to your liking/needs!

![setupconfig](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebfcb89e-b1a5-4957-a8f0-78dc1de8c8e2)

If all done correctly, it should display as so:
