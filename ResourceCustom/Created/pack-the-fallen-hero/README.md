for this plugin pack, I do recommend having either fixed classic mode (or my preference, Resizable classic mode). If you do decide to use resizable classic mode, I've detailed a few important plugins (mostly Stretched Mode and Fixed Resizable Hybrid, being the two most important).


Before we get started below are some References: 

I combined many assets from the following, so be sure to check those guys out.

Below are my recommendations for plugins that attune to my plugins compatibilities.


These settings were made on a 1920 x 1080 screen, stretched mode and other plugin settings may differ.

Must have Plugins:

	; if you are using [Fixed - Classic Layout]

		⚒️ Stretched Mode
			[Increased performance mode] 		turned on (if you are not using any HD or GPU plugins). This is to reduce blur.
			[Integer scaling] 			OFF ❌
			[Keep aspect ratio] 			ON ✅ 
			[Resizable scaling] 			100%	
		

	; if you are using [Resizable - Classic Layout] <<<< Recommended

		⚒️ Fixed Resizable Hybrid <<<<< Important Plugin!! 
			Defaults options are fine
			
	; if you are using [Resizable - Modern Layout]

		⚒️ Stretched Mode
			Stretched Mode is optional, set the scaling to whatever feels right to you.		

HD Plugins:
		
	⚒️ GPU
