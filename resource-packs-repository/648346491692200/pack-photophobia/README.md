## Is this Safe to use/Can I get banned for using this?
This resource pack is part of another plugin, '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)', which is part of the official @Runelite [Plugin Hub](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub). All Plugins that get successfully merged into [Plugin Hub](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub) have been verified by the @Runelite development team and confirmed safe to use, as stated in their [readme](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub#Reviewing). 

In turn, [Runelite itself has been confirmed as fully compliant by Jagex](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1).
