# RuneScape 3 Resource Pack for RuneLite

## Description

As someone who cares about UI/UX, ever since I discovered the Resource Pack plugin I wanted to create a RS3-inspired UI that feels responsive and intuitive when using it. 

While there were an abundance of RS3 assets already available, the vast majority of them had to be resized or reworked to fit the Old School RuneScape interface dimensions.

My goal was to create each sprite from the highest quality source material available and achieve the best visual quality. Resizing was done using the CubicSpline algorithm as this produced the best results for downscaling. 

## Tools
