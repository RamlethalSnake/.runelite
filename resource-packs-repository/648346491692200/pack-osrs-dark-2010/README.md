Dark mode 2010scape UI.

## Making this pack work with the `Interface Styles` plugin
Here is how to make the Interface Styles plugin (i.e. High detail menu, High detail health bars) to work with this Resource pack.
1. First disable **both** the Interface Styles plugin and the Resource packs plugin.
2. Then in the Interfaces Styles plugin, make sure  `Gameframe` is set to `Default`.
3. Now, turn on the Interface Styles plugin **first** and then the Resource packs plugin **second**. 

If it somehow bugs out and your interface looks messed up just repeat the above steps.

> ⚠️ Having the `Gameframe` setting **not** set to `Default` within the `Interface Styles` plugin ***will*** make the menu icons misalign. Make sure your Interface Styles settings are set to the correct things as outlined above. 

Besides that, some stone tab icons (namely the corners) cannot be lined up perfectly in Fixed mode and Classic Resizable mode. I recommend playing with `Resizable - Modern layout` for the best experience. I tried my best to make the pack be at least on par with the Interface Styles plugin.

##Cross sprites
RSHD (RS3) cross sprites are built into the pack. To enable/disable them, go into `Resource packs` plugin settings and tick `Allow mouse click sprite to be changed`.
