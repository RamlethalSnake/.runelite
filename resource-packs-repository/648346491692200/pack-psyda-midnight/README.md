# Psyda Midnight

This is Psyda's Midnight Theme for the OSRS UI - It works in Fixed and Resizable, and has most icons availabled skinned.

It's been designed to look cleaner and more minimal taking inspiration from early 2000s dungeon crawler styled RPGs.

To use this Resource Pack you must first install Runelite, as well as the external plugin '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' from the plugin hub.

You should be able to download the pack from directly within the plugin.

**Note:** *Some textures are still missing, this is due to the current version of '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' (v1.0.5) not supporting said textures, I will update this resource-pack as new versions of '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' are released.*

As more functionality is added to the resource packs, I'd like to add a lot more quirks to the theme making it more unique.
