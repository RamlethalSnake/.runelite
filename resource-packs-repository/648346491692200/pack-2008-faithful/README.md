# 2008 Faithful
## by BongoBooty

This pack is a faithful recreation of the 2008 interface in Runescape 2. It is as close as possible, with the addition of Vorkath in the minimap to cover up necessary pixels due to the limitation of resource packs, and some choice things left alone. Changes include the minimap area, orbs, pillars, frame, inventory texture, and updated skill icons.
