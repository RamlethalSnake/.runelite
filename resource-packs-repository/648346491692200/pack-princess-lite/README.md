# PrincessLite Theme for OSRS by Princess dps

To use this Resource Pack you must first install Runelite, as well as the external plugin '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' from the plugin hub.

You must then download the latest zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs/archive/pack-princess-lite.zip), Extract it to a folder and then follow the instructions on the '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' plugin page.

**Note:** I will update this plugin as new versions of '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)' are released.* 

## Is this Safe to use/Can I get banned for using this?
This resource pack is part of another plugin, '[Resource Packs](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)', which is part of the official @Runelite [Plugin Hub](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub). All Plugins that get successfully merged into [Plugin Hub](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub) have been verified by the @Runelite development team and confirmed safe to use, as stated in their [readme](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub#Reviewing). 

In turn, [Runelite itself has been confirmed as fully compliant by Jagex](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1).
