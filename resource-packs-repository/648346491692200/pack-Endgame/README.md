# Endgame (by W 0 N D 3 R)

Endgame is a dark mode pack with a black/grayscale color palette and accents of "Maiden" colors (white and red). This themed pack is inspired by endgame content in OSRS, with an emphasis on the grandmaster Zuk helm. Most assets used in pvm/pvp are vanilla to not affect gameplay, or are slightly recolored to fit the theme (icons for prayers and spells are untouched).

Created all elements using Krita and ibisPaint X by me.
