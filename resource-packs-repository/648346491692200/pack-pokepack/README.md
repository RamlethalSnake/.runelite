# PokéPack (by Jiro)

![icon](https://i.imgur.com/ElivxSU.png)

A pack based (mostly!) on the 3rd generation of Pokémon games. Includes some alternates for certain U.I elements, so if you want to slightly customise them, please do! If any icons seem too clashing or confusing for your personal tastes I also encourage changing it to however you see fit. :)

There are still a few things to iron out such as the Make-X menu but it will be updated in the future, you won't need to reinstall.

I recommend using the Resizeable Modern style as it was made with that in mind, however all styles are supported. Thanks for downloading.
