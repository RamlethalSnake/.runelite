Girlypop Pack is a light mode pack with a pink and white marble color palette. This themed pack is inspired by various feminine pop culture references, including Clueless, Paris Hilton, Mean Girls, Legally Blonde, Barbie, Pretty Little Liars, Bratz, Powerpuff Girls, and Cheetah Girls. It also has other designs based off of Y2K style. 

Created all elements using Krita and ibisPaint X by me.
