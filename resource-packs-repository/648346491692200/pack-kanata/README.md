# Kanata (by vmp)
#### A RuneLite resource pack inspired by Kyoukai no Kanata

## Description
***Kyoukai no Kanata*** is my favorite anime and I originally made this pack for myself because I wanted Mirai Kuriyama _(best girl)_ all over my game! ^^

It was originally just thrown together, only having necessary UI elements for my own gameplay, missing many interfaces and buttons.

Over time, more and more people asked about my pack and if they could have it. After seeing how many people wanted it I finally decided to finish it up into a shareable state!

Although I am an amateur graphic designer, I'd rather be honest and say I have no idea what I'm doing here. It may be janky and slapped together but I hope you enjoy my resource pack either way! :)

***(Reminder that this was just my personal gameplay resource pack before people wanted it!)***

###### also, go watch _Kyoukai no Kanata_ if you haven't!


## Chat Colors
#### You will have to change your chat colors to use this resource pack. Default chat colors are very dark and you will not be able to read!

You can use the **`Chat Color`** RuneLite plugin (recommended) or the chat colors in the ingame settings.

Unfortunately there are **no presets nor easy ways to change these on a whim,** so changing your chat colors to use this pack is sort of **"investing"** in it.

Questing may be annoying with this pack due to NPC dialogue using unchangeable dark colors in the chatbox. **I don't recommend questing with it.**

## Reused UI Elements
#### Certain UI elements may look weird due to how textures are reused ingame. There is nothing I can do about these as it is an issue with the game.

#### Examples:
- **`Resizable (Modern)`** Inventory texture uncentered
- Boss health bars
- Hovering over certain UI elements/buttons **(such as PoH storages or Settings buttons)**

## Cross Sprite
#### Mirai swings her sword on "red-x" actions! You can toggle this in the Resource packs plugin settings.

#### Included [here](https://i.imgur.com/M2VJ28q.png) is an alternative login screen without Mirai in the middle you can download!
##### If you prefer this screen, you can install it using the **`Login Screen`** plugin. It should overwrite the screen used by the resource pack. Instructions can be found [here.](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Login-Screen#custom-background)

## Resizable (Classic) Mode

## Resizable (Modern) Mode
#### Due to how `Resizable (Modern)` uses the inventory texture, causing it to be uncentered, I can't recommend using it with this pack but it's still usable.

## Special Thanks

- **`haffy`** for making the cross-sprite animation for me, and helping me with other stuff to get the pack ready to share! **(try his _Project Miku_ resource pack or else)**

- **`Nichy`** for a few dark mode textures **(any dark gray version of vanilla OSRS textures)** for things I couldn't be bothered to change or things I liked the way they are.
