# Rs3xOsrs Resource Pack for RuneLite

![icon](https://i.imgur.com/dkiXMCt.png)

## Description

Mix of OSRS and RS3 interface styles.

Image editing and creating has been longtime hobby of mine. I've played runescape for years and have seen the glory of 2008 and fall of playerbase from evolution of combat, free trade and wilderness removal updates. I always liked runescape 3 legacy UI, so I
decided to make my own vision of it for oldschool runescape. I've mainly used assets from Frankz's "RS3" resource pack, so big chunk of credits should go straight to him. This pack is mainly made for my personal usage, but will get updated whenever i have
free time and am still playing OSRS.
