# OSRS Wiki Browntown (by Nichy)

A resource pack based on the recently added OSRS Wiki dark theme, Browntown. A lot of the frequently updating sprites are kept vanilla so it should retain good visual compatibility going forward.
The pack looks best with the High Detail menu enabled from the Interface Styles plugin and the RS3 Gold cursor from the Custom Cursor plugin.

## Credits
A big thank you to the OSRS Wiki team for all they do. They made the palette which served inspiration for this pack.
Thanks to Shayani for adding the palette's hex codes to https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Theme, this made it way easier to make the pack in one afternoon.
