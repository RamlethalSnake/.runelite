# Brown Theme

This pack gives the vanilla interface a nice dark brown hue and is meant to thematically go with the 'high detail menu' option in the base client's Interface Styles plugin. I've added a few personal touches and changes to make the whole thing work. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to hit me on twtiter I'm @6cythe :)
