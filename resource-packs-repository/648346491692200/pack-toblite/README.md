# Theatre of Blood Resource Pack for RuneLite

![icon](https://i.imgur.com/b77JmhC.png)

## Description

A resource pack based on the RuneScape raid Theatre of Blood.

I wanted to include customization for the pack, but only really got around to making alternatives for one thing, which are the pillars for the "Resizable - Classic" layout. If anyone wants to request any alternatives for the pack, then they can contact me at sayoko on Discord. If the pack isn't working, or you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me there.

Here is a [Google Doc (TOB Resource Pack - Alternatives)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qn72cRA1y3keBnq78YAaTwXe-qgFsYqCkgnhP_Tt_5I/edit?tab=t.0) that contains the files of the alternative files.

All assets are made by me, and other work can be found at my [carr.d: degradee-OSRS](https://degradee-osrs.carrd.co/)
