KuromiLite is a dark mode pack with accents of muted pastel pinks and purples. This themed pack is inspired by the Sanrio character, Kuromi, with some features of My Melody, Baku, and Kuromi Nui. This pack is perfect for cozy gaming, or there's two alternative minimap designs for resizeable mode that are simpler for pvm/pvp. If you would like to replace the minimap in resizeable so the map isn't occluded by the original bow design, you can choose from this link to replace it https://imgur.com/a/YB9NDkh.

I hope you enjoy this first pack, and maybe more in the future!
Created all elements using Krita and ibisPaint X by me.
